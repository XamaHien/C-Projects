           8 Ways To Get People To Visit 
           Your Web Site Again And Again!
          ================================

  by Larry Dotson


  1. Polls

  Hold an interactive poll on your web site. Ask visitors a poll
  question. Have them e-mail their vote or opinion. People love
  to give their 2 cents worth. They would also like to read the
  results the next day or week on your web site.


  2. Prize Drawings

  Hold an ongoing prize drawing on your web site. The prizes
  should be something of interest or value to your subscribers.
  Most people who enter will continually revisit your web site
  to get the results.


  3. Original Content

  Give your visitors content they can't read anywhere else.
  I'm not saying all your content has to be 100% original, but a
  portion of your web site should have original information.
  People will usually read information they haven't read before.


  4. Quizes

  Give your visitors a quiz or a series of trivia questions. Post
  the correct answers weekly on your web site. The people
  who participate will want to come back to your site to see
  if they were right.


  5. News

  Supply news stories related to your web site topic. People
  want current and up-to-date news. If you can be their first
  source, they will become repeat visitors to your web site.


  ====================================================
  Stay Informed! Get Special Deals on topics like:

  [x] Affiliate Programs 
  [x] E-Commerce 
  [x] Webmaster tools
  [x] Web Design and Promotion 
  [x] Business Opportunities 
  ......and much more! 

  It's FREE! at http://www.stay-informed.com
  ====================================================  


  6. Jokes

  Give your visitors a little humor now and then. Don't be so
  serious; tell them a joke. If they associate your web site with
  being happy they will visit again and again.


  7. Free Stuff

  People love to get free stuff. List free stuff on your web site.
  It could be software, services, sample products, e-books etc.
  The freebies should be related to your web site topic. Keep
  the freebies coming and your visitors will return regulary.


  8. Directories

  Tell your subscribers about Web sites related to your web
  site topic. The web sites should be interesting and helpful.
  Become your readers web site directory and they will come
  back.

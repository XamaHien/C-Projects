<h2>Internet Privacy Directive - Volvo Car Corporation</h2>

<div>
<p>We at Volvo Car Corporation (Volvo) respect and safeguard the personal integrity of everyone who visits our websites. The information gathered on you will be used principally so that we can provide you with what you have asked for, and secondly to improve what we supply and our service.

<p>Gathered information will not be released to anyone outside Volvo Car Corporation, our dealers or other partners who provide you with a service on our behalf. The information will be treated in accordance with relevant legislation with regard to personal data protection and may initially be stored or processed, within or outside the European Union, anywhere in the world.</p>

<h2>What are the benefits to me of Volvo collecting my information?</h2>

<p>1.&nbsp;To make the Site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp;Help us to provide information faster.&nbsp;<br />

</div>

<div>
<h2>What information might be collected by Volvo Web Sites?</h2>

<p>At Volvo, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can visit Volvo on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address. It is our intent to let you know before we collect information from you on the Internet.</p>

<p>We will only collect personal information that can be directly associated with you after you have completed a Internet registration process.</p>

<p>Even before registration we will collect anonymous information about how you have used the Web Site. This is a common standard procedure for any Web Site on the Internet. The information collected does not personally identify you but may be helpful to us for marketing purposes or improving the services we offer.</p>

<p>If you choose to give Volvo personal information via the Internet that we may need e.g. to correspond with you, process an order or provide you with a subscription, it is our intention to let you know how we will use such information. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>How will Volvo collect and store this information?</h2>
The Site can collect information about you in a number of ways; either directly requesting it from you (as on a registration form) or by automatically recording information about your visit to this Site. For example we might collect data regarding your journey through the Site or record the options that you have chosen to take.

<p>Information is stored in a secure environment protected by a combination of physical and technical measures. There is no general public access to this information.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>For how long will Volvo store the information?</h2>

<p>Volvo will store the information in a secure and protected environment for as long as we believe it will better help us to understand how we can serve you, and respect your wishes. In addition legislation might oblige us to store information for a certain period of time.</p>

<p>To understand how you can amend, or update information stored about you please refer to the appropriate question in this section.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Where will your personal information be stored?</h2>
Volvo operates in many countries around the world. To enable us to offer consistent service to you, our customers, wherever you may be, we manage our Internet sites from sites all around the world.</div>

<div>
<h2>Why do Volvo collect this information?</h2>
We need this information to help us improve our services to you; we want to make it easier to tailor our products and services to your particular needs.</div>

<div>
<h2>Who does this policy apply to?</h2>
This policy applies to web sites designed for the use of individual consumers; it does not apply to corporate visitors.</div>

<div>
<h2>Volvo&rsquo;s Commitment to Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>
Protecting the privacy of children is important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our web site from those we actually know are under 13 years of age without first obtaining verifiable parental consent, and we will not condition participation on a child providing more personally identifiable information than is necessary to participate in the activity. Upon request, parents may review their child&rsquo;s information or request it may be deleted.</div>

<div>
<h2>What are Cookies?</h2>

<p>There is a technology called &quot;cookies&quot; which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a Web Site. A cookie is an element of data, a file which is nothing but a line of text, that a Web Site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. Some Volvo pages use cookies so that we can better serve you when you return to our Site. For example a cookie might help you to avoid having to re-enter data you have given us before.</p>

<p>You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>What are Customer Profiles?</h2>

<p>Every registered customer has a unique personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.</p>

<p>When you register, we create your profile, assign to you a personal identification number, then might send this personal identification number back to your hard drive in the form of a cookie. This code is uniquely yours. It is your passport to seamless travel across many of the Volvo Web Sites. This might allow you to visit Sites without having to fill out multiple registration forms with information you&#39;ve already provided. Even if you switch computers, you won&#39;t have to re-register - just use your Registration ID to identify yourself.</p>

<p>Your customer profile might also be used to customise what you see on the Web Site to meet your personal preferences and settings.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>How do I correct information about myself?</h2>
Some Volvo Web Sites operate registration pages that allow you to review and update the Personal Information you have submitted. Elsewhere, you are simply given the option of cancelling your membership of the service. In other cases where you need to correct Personal Information you have submitted previously to a Volvo Site please follow the instructions provided.</div>

<div>
<h2>What about Internet &amp; Site Security?</h2>

<p>The Internet is not a secure system and you should always be cautious about the information you disclose whilst on-line.</p>

<p>Personal Information collected by Volvo Sites is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. In some cases, such as the transmission of credit card numbers, the Personal Information is encrypted before you conduct your transaction, using appropriate secure technology.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>What options do I have if I choose to register?</h2>

<p>If you decide to register, you will be able to choose if you want further contacts from Volvo. If you do not want Volvo to communicate with you about other offers regarding Volvo products, programs, events, or services you should take the appropriate option.</p>

<p>These offers might be sent to you by e-mail, postal mail, telephone or any other appropriate means.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>What happens if I choose not to register?</h2>

<p>If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you will in most cases still be able to use most of the Volvo Web Sites. However you will not be able to access areas that require registration.</p>

<p>Even if you do not register we will sometimes collect anonymous information about how you have used the Web Site. This is information that does not personally identify you but which may be helpful for marketing or improving the services we offer.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Under what conditions might this Privacy Policy not operate?</h2>
In addition to directly providing information to a Volvo Web Site, you might also provide Personal Information through chat sessions, e-mail exchanges or bulletin board use made available to you on Volvo Web Sites. The Privacy Policy does not cover this type of transfer of your Personal Information. You should always be careful when distributing your Personal Information in this manner.</div>

<div>
<h2>How do I contact you?</h2>
If you have any questions concerning this Internet Privacy Directive or otherwise on the handling of personal data at Volvo, contact us at the following address:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:persdata@volvocars.com">persdata@volvocars.com</a></div>
